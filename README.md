# Thneed Inc Business

## Description
- Allows Thneed Inc business employees to place orders for Thneeds and review those orders for date of arrival and contents of the delivery.

- The whole project itself is built through the Java language and the GUI is built with XML via the ScreenBuilder application to place GUI elements on different scene.
- Java was used due to its array of GUI elements that was pre-built alongside being a object-oriented language that helps with controlling different GUI elements and allowing them to interact with each other.
- XML was chosen because it was the primary way of building GUI elements via Screen Builder, which we chose to use due to it allowing us to visualize elements in a more clear and defined way on the screen.
