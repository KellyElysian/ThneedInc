# Thneed Inc Business

## Description - Functionality
- Allows Thneed Inc business employees to place orders for Thneeds and review those orders for date of arrival and contents of the delivery.
- This was created to be a business solution to a (not real) company that requires a solution for allowing them to place orders of the items they sell. They also wanted to keep track of which of these orders have been completed and on what date and time.

## Description - Technology
- The whole project itself is built through the Java language and the GUI is built with XML via the ScreenBuilder application to place GUI elements on different scene.
- Java was used due to its array of GUI elements that was pre-built alongside being a object-oriented language that helps with controlling different GUI elements and allowing them to interact with each other.
- XML was chosen because it was the primary way of building GUI elements via Screen Builder, which we chose to use due to it allowing us to visualize elements in a more clear and defined way on the screen.
